When does wire service run?
1. Deafult value for wired proeprties and function
   ==> A wired property, or a wired function's result object,is assigned a defualt 
       value after component construction and before any other lifecycle event.
   ==>The default value is an object with data and error properties of undefined
   ==> Once data is available, it goes in data while error will be undefined. if an           error occurs, it goes in error while data will be undefined.
2. Wired function Execution
  ==>The function is invoked whenever a value is available,which can be before or           after the component is connected or rendered.
